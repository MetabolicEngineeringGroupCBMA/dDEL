# The dDEL assay

### [The structure of the pRS6 plasmid](The_structure_of_the_pRS6_plasmid_used_in_the_del_assay.ipynb)

This notebook contains a compilation of information on the construction of the pRS6 plasmid found in published literature.
The pRS6 plasmid was used to construct the original DEL cassette. View on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/dDEL/blob/master/The_structure_of_the_pRS6_plasmid_used_in_the_del_assay.ipynb).

### [pPS1 assembly](pPS1_assembly.ipynb)

This notebook shows how the pPS1 plasmid was constructed. The pPS1 plasmid was the initial assembly of the dDEL cassette. View on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/dDEL/blob/master/pPS1_assembly.ipynb).

### [Integration of ddel cassette in HIS3 locus](Integration_of_ddel_in_HIS3_locus.ipynb)

This notebook shows how a part of the pPS1 plasmid was integrated in the S. cerevisiae genome at the HIS3 locus.

## Automatic testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/dDEL.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/dDEL)

Jupyter notebooks in this repository are tested using a continuous integration service.
A fresh install of all depending software is performed once per month or whenever the files in this repository change.
The tests compare the previously saved output from each notebook code cell with a newly calculated output. 
If the content do not match for any cell, the badge above turns red. 
Click on the badge to see the details of the tests.
