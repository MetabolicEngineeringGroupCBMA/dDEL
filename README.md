# The dDEL assay

### [The structure of the pRS6 plasmid](The_structure_of_the_pRS6_plasmid_used_in_the_del_assay.ipynb)

This notebook contains a compilation of information on the construction of the pRS6 plasmid that was used to
construct the original DEL cassette.

### [pPS1 assembly](pPS1_assembly.ipynb)

This notebook shows how the pPS1 plasmid was constructed.

### [Integration of ddel cassette in HIS3 locus](Integration_of_ddel_in_HIS3_locus.ipynb)

This notebook shows how a part of the pPS1 plasmid was integrated in the S. cerevisiae genome.
