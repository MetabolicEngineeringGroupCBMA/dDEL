# The dDEL assay

### [The structure of the pRS6 plasmid](The_structure_of_the_pRS6_plasmid_used_in_the_del_assay.ipynb)

This notebook contains a compilation of information on the construction of the pRS6 plasmid that was used to
construct the original DEL cassette.

### [pPS1 assembly](pPS1_assembly.ipynb)

This notebook shows how the pPS1 plasmid was constructed.

### [Integration of ddel cassette in HIS3 locus](Integration_of_ddel_in_HIS3_locus.ipynb)

This notebook shows how a part of the pPS1 plasmid was integrated in the S. cerevisiae genome.

Jupyter notebooks in this repository are tested using a continuous integration service. 
A fresh install of all depending software is performed once per month or whenever the files in this repository change.
The tests compare the previously saved output from each code cell with a newly calculated output. 
If the content do not match for any cell, the badge above turns red. 
The bagde is also a link to the server where the tests are performed.
